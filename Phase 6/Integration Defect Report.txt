Issue 1:
The original phase 3 test script works fine on Matt's computer(Only Linux user), but on mine computer
and Jude's computer, most of the tests failed. The cause is for some reason, everytime when
the price number is modified, the transaction fails. We were able to efficiently overcome this issue
by writing our scripts for our divided part of the work, then Matt will integrate and script into
his BackEnd.

Issue 2:
While doing weekly transaction merge, adding each new file to the weekly data file
appended the first line of the new file to the last line of weekly data file!
Had to provide command "sed -i -e '$a\' *.data" to prevent this issue and add new file
strating from a new line.

Issue 3:
When attempting to compile and run the back end programs from the main directory,
there was an issue wih the "java" command after compiling the code.
Researching this problem raised several reasons, and most likely is due to path issues, especially classpath.
Another path was taken instead, which was to 'cd' into the directory then compile & run the code from there.
